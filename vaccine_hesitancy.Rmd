The CDC provides data on vaccine hesitancy at the state level using the U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey (HPS). Using this dataset provides we can describe trends in vaccine hesitancy across the United States. Results from this section can help to shed light on the important questions of what factors are associated with vaccine hesitancy, how vaccine hesitancy has affected vaccine uptake, and subsequently the trajectory of the pandemic.
