## Motivation

Considering the recent and ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we are interested in understanding how COVID-19 vaccination has impacted the trajectory of the pandemic in the United States and in New York City specifically. To that end, we will use data from the New York Times, Our World in Data, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization to explore the case rates and death rates attributable to COVID-19 since January 2020 until November 2021. 

We are interested in comparing trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths pre- and post-vaccination in the United States. We would also like to understand patterns of vaccine hesitancy and how this has impacted vaccine uptake and COVID cases and mortality across the country. We will focus in specifically on New York City and similarly describe trends in COVID-19 disease and vaccinations. To achieve this, we will stratify our gathered data into a pre- and post-vaccine rollout time period and compare the increase in cases and deaths between these two strata. Weâ€™ll use linear models to investigate whether the rollout of the vaccine had an effect on the case and death rates. Using data from boroughs in New York City, we will compare these models between areas with lower vaccine uptake compared to higher vaccine uptake areas to determine the local effects of vaccine availability. (Optional: To bolster the validity of these results, we will compare case and death rates from the 3-5 states with the lowest vaccine uptake to the 3-5 states with the highest vaccine uptake and see if the relationships are similar to those in New York City, in order to corroborate the trends on a larger scale.)

Similarly, we are interested in how the trends in case and fatality rates differ when stratified by season/quarter. We know that they were particularly high in winter, and unfortunately we have limited data for winters pre- and post-vaccine release at this point. We do however have more information for other seasons/quarters before and after vaccines became available, and are interested in comparing these rates by time period in addition to overall. We can use linear models for these strata as well to investigate whether or not there was a large difference in rates by season alone, and by season based on whether or not vaccines were available.

(Additional optional: We thought it would be interesting to compare the case and death rates from the United States with countries that took different approaches to curbing the virus, as well as comparing these rates pre- and post- vaccine release in those countries to investigate the effect that the vaccine rollout had internationally. Examples of countries that hit the hardest include India, the United States, Brazil, Russia, and Mexico, and examples of regions that were not as devastated by COVID-19 include Africa, Australia, Hong Kong.)


## Related Work

The inspiration for this exploratory data analysis was largely drawn from the fact that we are still facing the effects of this pandemic every day in many facets of life. Although school has largely returned to in-person instruction, we are still living in a world polarized by vaccine uptake and mask-wearing opinions, with online conference and meeting tools still at the center of nearly everything we do. Because of the life-altering forces of the pandemic, we have a wealth of data and metrics related to the virus to sift through and attempt to make some sense out of. Although there exist numerous dashboards and interpretations of COVID-19 data online, we were interested in how vaccine rollout has affected the spread of the virus and the case and death rates and numbers across the country and globally. We were unable to find this type of analysis easily online and figured it would be a worthwhile question to ask and answer. Comparing trends between areas with large vaccine uptake to those with lower vaccine uptake in addition to stratifying data based on dates when vaccines became readily available should shed some light on its practical effect in combating this global pandemic. 


## Initial Questions

How do trends in cases and deaths compare in the U.S. and NYC (and globally) from January 2020 to November 2021?

How has the vaccine been distributed in these areas? What are the rates of uptake/vaccination?

What are the differences in COVID-19 deaths by different subgroups (age, sex, race, etc.)? Are these differences statistically significant?

What are the trends in mask usage, disease rates, and vaccine rates and how are they related to one another or isolated by region?

What are trends in vaccination, vaccine hesitancy, and allocation of vaccine type and how do they compare across NYC and the United States?

How did the release of vaccines affect the case and death rates in NYC and across the country? Did they have an effect? What about in areas with low vs high vaccination rates?

How do the seasonal/quarterly rates of COVID-19 infection differ and are they significantly different for the same seasons/quarters pre- and post-vaccine availability?
